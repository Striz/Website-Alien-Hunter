       <p class="asgard">Thor is the Asgardian strongest god of thunder son of  Odin  and possesses the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him the ability  of flight and weather manipulation,  keen senses  that allow him to track objects traveling faster than light and hear cries from the other side of the planet. Thor has the ability to travel through time.Thor has shown the ability to regenerate wounded portions of his body, he has superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes, enabling him to deflect bullets with his hammer. Like all Asgardians, he has immunity to all Earthly diseases and some resistance to magic. Exceptionally powerful magic can overwhelm Odin's enchantment that transforms him between Asgardian and mortal forms.</p>
